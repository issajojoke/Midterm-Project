# Midterm-Project Objective
 	
	To work in coordination with my partner and learn techniques and understand work life in a real setting. Improve on communication and management skills to submit and complete everything in a timely manner.Moreover work with concepts previously grasped and make the foundation stronger.

#Process
	
	Finding the right data to work with was a challenge, as we were just finishing up one project and moving to the other  Joline and I decided it was best to use a data which was easier to use, so after a lot of research we selected a data from kaggle, link is as follows- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/global-food-prices .This data talks about the commodity prices in over 70 countries. 
	Joline and I thought it was best to divide the tasks in between us to make the most of the way our schedules were so we prepared a timeline and set goals. First step was the cleaning and EDA process, which you can find in the EDA notebook in the notebooks folder.

#Challenges
	With 2 people being involed time-management was definately the biggest challenge to make sure each part was completed by the respective person so that the next steps were not hindered. Finding data that would interest both of us was the next big task.
