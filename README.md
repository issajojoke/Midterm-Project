# Midterm-Project Objective
 	
	To work with a partner and learn how to strategize and find techniques that help us work as a team, allowing us to understand the challenges and upsides of working in a team setting. Improve on communication and management skills to submit and complete everything in a timely manner. Finally, work with concepts previously learnt to further understand and improve, with the goal of strengthening the foundation of these skills.

#Process
	
	Finding the right data to work with was a challenge, as we were just finishing up one project and moving to the other we decided it was best to use a data which was easier to use, so after a lot of research we selected a data from kaggle, link is as follows- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/global-food-prices .This data talks about the commodity prices in over 70 countries. 
	We thought it was best to divide the tasks in between us to make the most of the way our schedules were so we prepared a timeline and set goals. First step was the cleaning and EDA process, which you can find in the EDA notebook in the notebooks folder. Second step was to create the statistical models using python


#Results



#Challenges

	With 2 people being involved, time-management was definately the biggest challenge to make sure each part was completed by the respective person so that the next steps were not hindered. With the limited time we had to complete the project, and our scheduling conflicts, it was hard to find a time where we were both available to work on the project simultaneously. Finding data that would interest both of us was the next big task. Creating the statistical model was quite difficult since our data was mostly categorical, it was difficult to find a model that was best suited for the relationship we wanted to explore and describe. 

 #If we had more time

 	We would have more opportunities to call each other and work on the project coincidingly to make things a bit easier.
